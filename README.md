# Corpus Builder

This is a simple script for collecting github repositories that use a 
certain programming language and have their dependencies stored in a file.

To use, simply execute the `corpus_builder.sh` file. There must be a 
`libraries.txt` file containing the dependencies to look for and a 
`exclude_topics.txt` file with a list of github topics to exclude.
